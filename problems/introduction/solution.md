# YOU DID IT!

In the upcoming challenges we'll describe more in depth what's happening.

## The most important bit for now:

`console.log()` prints the values that are between the parentheses to the terminal.

So `console.log("COOOOL")` will print `COOOOL` the terminal.

We will use this in many of the upcoming challenges.
