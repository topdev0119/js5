# O-oh, something isn't working.
But don't panic!
Check next things:
  1) did you type the name of the file correctly? You can check by running `ls introduction.js`, if you see `ls: cannot access introduction.js: No such file or directory` then you should create new file / rename existing or change directories to the one with file
  2) make sure you didn't omit parens, since otherwise compiler would not be able to parse it
  3) make sure you didn't do any typos in the string itself
