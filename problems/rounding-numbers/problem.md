# ROUNDING NUMBERS

Numbers can be integers, like `2`, `14`, or `4353`, or they can be decimals,  
also known as floats, like `3.14`, `1.5`, or '100.7893423'.

## The challenge:

Create a file named rounding-numbers.js.

In that file define a variable named `roundUp` that references the float `1.5`.

We will use the `Math.round()` method to round the number up.

An example of using `Math.round()`:

```js
Math.round(0.5);
```

Define a second variable named `rounded` that references the output of the `Math.round()` method, passing in the `roundUp` variable as the argument.

Use `console.log()` to print that number to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

`javascripting verify rounding-numbers.js`
